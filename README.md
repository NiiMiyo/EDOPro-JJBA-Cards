# JJBA - EDOPro Custom Cards
Made with [YGOFabrica](https://github.com/piface314/ygo-fabrica/), this project is an expansion for [EDOPro](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis/EDOPro) with cards based on the show [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure) .

# ⚠️Warning ⚠️
- Card's effects are based on the actual characters, stands and concepts of the show. You may face spoilers from parts 1 (Phantom Blood) through part 6 (Stone Ocean).

- Parts 7 (Steel Ball Run) and 8 (JoJolion) are also intended to be added in the future.

- For now, this expansion uses card codes from `1090076072` to `1090076085` and archetype codes from `0xf00` to `0xf02`. As more cards are added, the amount of codes may increase, so always make sure it does not conflict with other expansions you may use.
